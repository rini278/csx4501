# Project description:

I have used a text file for this project that contains the text of a Shakespeare play. The aim of this assignment is to look at the word frequencies in a Shakespeare play and to find the top 20 most frequent words in the play and to comment on whether these words give an accurate sense of the play.

## Shakespeare play - quote
"*Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun Peer'd forth the golden window of the east. A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where, underneath the grove of sycamore. That westward rooteth from the city's side, So early walking did I see your son Towards him I made, but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood I, measuring his affections by my own, That most are busied when they're most alone,Pursued my humour not pursuing his, And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.*."
