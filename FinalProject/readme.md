# Project description:

As I am curious about the rapid rise of Airbnbs, I have decided to work on a Airbnb dataset. Over half of homeowners would consider renting out their homes through a third-party app like Airbnb - the interesting article that nudged me to work on it is linked [here](https://listwithclever.com/research/airbnb-vs-hotels-study/).

## Context
"*Airbnb happened because two guys could not pay their rent, but did have some space*."

Yes, that's how **Air-bed and breakfast(Airbnb)** started when Joe and Martin from San Francisco rented out their three airbeds to make some cash. Since then, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique and personalized way. The story of Airbnb's foundation is fascinating.

* Airbnb is a hospitality service which enables people to lease or rent
* short-term accommodation.
* The company does not own any lodging. It is merely an agent.
* It receives a percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts for every booking.

A Host can create a listing by selecting the "Host" menu after logging in. The Price for the listing is decided by the host himself. The owner can charge different prices for nightly, weekly, and monthly stays. Hosts then add a description of the residence, amenities, available dates, cancellation policies, and any house rules. Potential guests are required to message the host directly through Airbnb to ask questions regarding the property. After the reservation, the hosts coordinate meeting times and contact information with the guests. Airbnb guests can leave a review and rate a listing after their stay. This rating can be used as an indicator of the experience they had during their stay.

## Content
What's inside is more than just rows and columns. Make it easy for others to get started by describing how you acquired the data and what time period it represents, too.

## Acknowledgements
The Dataset is from Inside Airbnb for Los Angeles location. "Inside Airbnb" is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows us to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world. Downloaded the dataset that I will use from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/oindrilasen/la-airbnb-listings/metadata).

## Analysis and Visualization
As we are learning about data visualization using python matplotlib and panda libraries, using a large dataset such as Airbnb would be a good challenge to explore various plotting methods and techniques.

## Conclusion
I expect to see the host and guest data plotted using python libraries and find out interesting outliers if there are any.
